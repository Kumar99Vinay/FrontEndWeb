        <h2>Lord ganesha</h2>
        <article>
            <p class="cl" id="para1">
                Ganesha, also spelled Ganesh, also called Ganapati, elephant-headed Hindu god 
                 of beginnings, who is traditionally worshipped before any
                  major enterprise and is the patron of intellectuals, bankers,
                   scribes, and authors.</p>
                  <p id="para2">His name means both “Lord of the People” 
                   (gana means the common people) and “Lord of the Ganas” 
                   (Ganesha is the chief of the ganas, the goblin hosts of Shiva).
